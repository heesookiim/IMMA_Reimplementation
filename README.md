### Overview

![pipeline](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/10fda64e-7cef-4e3b-9c25-418d644833d3)

This is reimplementation of ECCV 2024 paper - [IMMA:Immunizing text-to-image Models against Malicious Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18815).
IMMA takes in pre-trained model weights, images, and corresponding prompts for training. The output of IMMA is immunized model weights. **After IMMA training**, the immunized model functions as the new pre-trained model for further fine-tuning adaptation.
